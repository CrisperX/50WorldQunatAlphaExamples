# 50WorldQunatAlphaExamples
This is **an example of 50 Alphas** that can **pass the correlation test** if they are submitted together. 

## Description 

This is an example of 50 Alphas that can pass the correlation test if they are submitted together.

You can get inspiration from them and use your inspiration in the **WorldQuant Alphathon.**

**P.S. Principle of correlation test**

*correlation test is a test that compares the current Alpha to the former Alphas that you submitted before.*

*It means the 50 Alphas may fail your correlation test. All the 50 Alphas have been tested and proved that they themselves can pass the correlation test.*

## Why providing this
We offer **unique, easy-to-understand tutorials** and guides for beginners on the WorldQuant Brain platform. We help them master the principles and methods of mining Alphas and help them understand the various parameters and operators. Users can use them to earn WorldQuant gold medals, become WorldQuant Consultants, and **even win first place at the Alphathon**!

## How can we find these Alphas?
We have **a unique method** to find these Alphas, and it works perfectly. So far, we managed to find **over 400 Alphas** that can pass the correlation together and the method did not take much time. We can even find more!
